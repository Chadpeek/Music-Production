Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom
to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains
free software for all its users.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

for making modifications to it.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program.

You may run, modify and propagate covered works under the terms of
this License.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish
on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty.

You may convey a work based on the Program, provided that you also meet
all of these conditions:

a license from the original licensors.
